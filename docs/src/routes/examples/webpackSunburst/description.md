## Zoomable Sunburst

A zoomable sunburst of the webpack bundle for resonance.  Inspired by mbostock's [awesome example](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4348373).
This example uses redux and reselect to manage the state.  You can zoom in, browse to another page and return and it will remain in the zoom state you left it in.
