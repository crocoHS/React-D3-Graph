## Stacked Area Chart

This data used in the chart below is fake.  It shows series of data for 10 randomly chosen fruit names (150 points per series).
It uses the same data generator used in Mike Bostock's [stream graph example](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4060954).
If you refresh the page you will get a new random dataset.
